## Development

This project uses `maturin` and `hatch` for development, which can be installed with `pipx`.

```sh
# create a virtual env
hatch shell

# compile a development version of the package
maturin develop --release

# open the jupyter notebooks/
jupyterlab

A local build of `oxbow` will be added to your virtual environment.

```python
